Game 2 
EcoEater: The Compost Quest
Inspired by: minecraft and adopt me 
Start Round
Students enter blocky garden/island. Compi appears as their companion.
Collect Organic Scraps
Quickly explore the mini-garden to grab as many scraps as possible (fruit peels, leaves, veggie trimmings). -> 2-min countdown visible.
Feed Compi
Drag-and-drop scraps into CompiÔÇÖs compost bin.     Compi reacts immediately:
Healthy: ÔÇ£Yum! Plants will grow!ÔÇØ

Immediate Feedback
Points or garden growth indicators appear instantly. Visual: soil color darkens, plants sprout, Compi jumps happily
Garden evolves over time (even when the student isnÔÇÖt playing)
Plants grow slowly, animals appear, compost matures.
When they return, they see their progress accumulated, like Minecraft crops growing overnight.->  Makes students feel responsible for long-term success.
Plants grow gradually, block by block:
 seedling block
small plant block.
full flower/fruit tree.
Animals appear as the ecosystem stabilizes: bees, butterflies, worms.

*Students can see cause-effect visually without reading too much.
Daily missions (items will be hiding)E.g. 
Feed Compi specific scraps: e.g., ÔÇ£Feed 1 apple peel and 1 carrot leaf.ÔÇØ
Discover rare mini-animal: e.g., ÔÇ£Find the hidden earthworm block in your garden.ÔÇØ
Plant or grow a block: e.g., ÔÇ£Grow 1 flower or 1 vegetable block.ÔÇØ
Experiment challenge: e.g., ÔÇ£Combine 2 scraps to see which grows the plant fastest.ÔÇØ
Teaching or educating them afterwards (just a quick summary)
